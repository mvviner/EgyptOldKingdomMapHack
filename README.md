------
This utility is made to supplement the walkthrough of Egypt Old Kingdom game. Features:
1. The utility shows location of important things on both City and Egypt map (Egypt map is optional).
2. Also, while the utility is run it creates a backup copy of each save file, and if the save file gets deleted, it's automatically restored.

The utility shows your latest save file. Note that on harder difficulty settings the game creates its first save file on the 10th turn.
